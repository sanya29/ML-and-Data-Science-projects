# ML-and-Data-Science-projects

My Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab notebooks consisting of the end to end workflow of picking, applying, evaluating and improving Machine Learning models on a dog breed identifier (with transfer learning) and Bulldozer price predicter (regression), both from Kaggle, and a heart-disease dataset (logistic regression) from UCI.

**Note:** Before running the Dog Vision Deep Learning Google Colab notebook, keep in mind that the processes of training and testing the models (there are two cells that accomplish this) take 2 hours each. So do not blindly run all cells.

Makes use of: Pandas, Anaconda, NumPy, MatPlotLib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow 2, TensorFlow Hub
